Welcome to helanal's documentation!
=========================================================

This module contains code to analyse protein helices using the
HELANAL_ algorithm ([Bansal2000]_, [Sugeta1967]_).

HELANAL_ quantifies the geometry of helices in proteins on the basis of their
CÎ± atoms. It can determine local structural features such as the local
helical twist and rise, local helix origins and bending angles along the
helix.
